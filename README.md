# Closed-Loop-Stability-Analysis-with-Bairstow-Method
Closed-Loop control stability analysis by cheking the poles of the characteristic equation of the control loop. Bairstow method is a very powerful method for finding both real and complex root of polynomials. This method works based of factorizing quadratic polynomials from the original polynomial.
